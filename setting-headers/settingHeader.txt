what is the set doing?

set is Setting Headers


Headers:
    -> headers contain (often) meta data about the request itself

        example :
            Client -> GET /image --> Server (png, jpeg, gif) => server randomly choose one either png / gif / jpeg
                Accept: image/png -> (this is extra information about the request)

    -> Headers are key value pairs that contain extra information pertaining to the request, response or the client.

    -> cache-control (won't make the api request again if the data already exist. It will store in a memory for particular time and give it to you when you want)




Request
    => Request Type (GET, POST, ...)
    => Request URL
    => (Request Body) Optionally
        -> POST form data (any data)
    => Request Headers (0 or more)

    => Response Status Code (200, 201, 404, ...)
    => Response body (image / html / video / audio / ...)  -> there may be no body
